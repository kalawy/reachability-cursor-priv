Privileged Mode
:

Activating an accessibility service with the permission to perform gestures changes how the Android system processes touchscreen
inputs. This doesn't affect the overall performance of your device
but it can affect the smoothness of touch-based motions like
Scrolling. Until this little flaw is fixed in the Android system, you can
use the privileged mode which automatically disables the service
with the critical permission when you don't use Reachability
Cursor. To enable this mode 

this is a statement from the official app 



that forces you to use adb with a computer 

this module adds the application as priv-app in system whith this permission enabled by default
